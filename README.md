FInal In-Class Project

Project Author: Ryan Lund

Observations: 
1) The USA reported the highest Customer Count and the greatest Total Orders, however, it was ranked 3rd out of the top 5 countires for Average Freight Weight. This suggests that the average order weight for products shipped to the USA was lighter than Austria and Ireland, but heavier than Germany or Sweden (Germany had the 2nd highest customer count and Sweden reported low total orders.
